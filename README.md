# Managing matrices onto pattern recognition algorithms

## __What's this about__ ‚ùì
<p> This project focus onto the research of matricial manipulation to get the 'average' of strategical images and take conlution out of them. I expect ending it as a way to generalize different pattern prediction methods onto this code...</p>

## __Current build uses__ üõ†Ô∏è
For now, the class ```JPGFile``` can be used to:
- Convert images into matrices from given resolution (in all images)
- Convert matrices into images
Wait till the next __update__ to:
- Analize subject images to test the anomalities on the prediction
- GUI (Possibly PyQt5)

## **DEPENDENCIES**‚ùó
### Python version
Python 3.11.9
### Libraries üìö
- numpy --> 1.26.4
- pillow --> 10.3.0
