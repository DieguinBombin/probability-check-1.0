# Managing matrices onto pattern recognition algorithms

## DEPENDENCIES ❗

### Python version
Python 3.11.9

### Libraries 📚
<p>numpy --> 1.26.4
pillow --> 10.3.0</p>

## What's this about?
<p> This project focus onto the research of matricial manipulation to get the 'average' of strategical images and take conlution out of them. I expect ending it as a way to generalize different pattern prediction methods onto this code, so keep up...</p>
