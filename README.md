# Managing matrices onto pattern recognition algorithms

## __What's this about__ ‚ùì
<p> This project focus onto the research of matricial manipulation to get the 'average' of strategical images and develop conclutions out of those processes. I expect to modify it as a way to generalize different pattern prediction methods onto this code...</p>

## __Current build utilities__ üõ†Ô∏è
For now, we have **2 classes**, those are ```MatrixMeanList``` and ```JPGFile```, these two defined in the file ```jpg_n_classes.py```
### Theorical usses of the classes ü§§ü§§
- Get the predictive mean of given group of files, and renderize it as a **hotspot of anomalities visually**
- Get an array of type ```np.array``` or a **list of list** from the classes, but the last one isn't optimized yet. 

### Wait till the next __update__ to:
- Analize subject images to test the anomalities on the prediction.
- GUI (Possibly PyQt5). (At least some months... üò¢)
### Example of usages of the classes:
Just read the python files, hope it's üë®‚Äçü¶ºüë®‚Äçü¶ºüë®‚Äçü¶ºüë®‚Äçü¶ºüë®‚Äçü¶º
