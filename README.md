# Managing matrices onto pattern recognition algorithms

## __What's this about__ ❓
<p> This project focus onto the research of matricial manipulation to get the 'average' of strategical images and take conlution out of them. I expect ending it as a way to generalize different pattern prediction methods onto this code...</p>

## __Current build uses__ 🛠️
<p>For now, the class </p>p```JPGFile```<p> can be used to
- Convert images into matrices from given resolution (in all images)
- Convert matrices into images
Wait till the next update to:
- Analize subject images to test the anomalities on the prediction
- GUI (Possibly PyQt5)</p>

## __DEPENDENCIES__❗
### Python version
Python 3.11.9
### Libraries 📚
<p>numpy --> 1.26.4
pillow --> 10.3.0</p>
